# MPCS51220 HW2

Please put "hw2_db.txt" file on the same folder where "hw2_jhwang11.py" file exists.

I set some arbitrary price number for each price, but didn't use it since there is no specific requirement with them.

Also, I didn't use the discount rate given no specific 

I intentionally skipped a couple of functionalities such as "we cannot sell more tickets for a given route on a given day than the number of total seats." or "Tickets for Mondays thru Thursdays are always cheaper than those for on Friday, Saturdays, and Sundays."

It is because the requirements seem vague or make codes too complicated. I wanted to make them as simple as possible as instructed.
